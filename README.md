# CNA_trade_2019  


## Goal of the project: 
The goal of this project is to create a **bot** that buys different currencies considering the current market prices.  
This bot will be tested using the program *ai-bot-workspace*.  
The more made you made, the better your grade will be!  
:money_with_wings:  :money_with_wings:  :money_with_wings:  

## Achievement:  
**Note:** **12 / 16**  
**Grade:** **B**  

This bot uses an algorithm based on ***Exponential Moving averages***  
There is a lot of comments inside my code so it won't be so hard for you to understand how it works.
